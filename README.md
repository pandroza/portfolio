Has a nav-bar built with BootStrap which shrinks to burger menu for small screens.

On large screens has background created with CSS-DOODLE of FA icon SVG's that fade in and out and move in random directions.

### Site consists of four sections:

1. Header containing site name and headings about me. Under the site name is a HH/MM/SS clock with FA icons instead of numbers, built in JS. Unlike CSS-Doodle background icons, these are added with HTML *<a*> elements, not SVG's. 

1. About me section: A bio of me and what my skills are.

1. My Projects section: A showcase of my projects and links to them. Has stylized trapezium shaped background made with SVG. Projects are presented using Hexaflip. Layout of section changes for large and small screens.

1. Contact me section: My contact details and links to my CodePen and GitHub profiles.
