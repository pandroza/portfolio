My portfolio page

Built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, CSS-DOODLE, HEXAFLIP plugin and FONT AWESOME icons.

Has a nav-bar built with BootStrap which shrinks to burger menu for small screens.

On large screens has background created with CSS-DOODLE of FA icon SVG's that fade in and out and move in random directions.

Site consists of four sections:

1: Header containing site name and headings about me. Under the site name is a HH/MM/SS clock with FA icons instead of numbers, built in JS. Unlike CSS-Doodle background icons, these are added with HTML *<a*> elements, not SVG's. 

2:About me section: A bio of me and what my skills are.

3:My Projects section: A showcase of my projects and links to them. Has stylized trapezium shaped background made with SVG. Projects are presented using Hexaflip. Layout of section changes for large and small screens.

4:Contact me section: My contact details and links to my CodePen and GitHub profiles.
